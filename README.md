The purpose of this device is to create a motion sensor that logs every time it is triggered in '/home/$USER'. 
Each time the motion sensor is triggered, a red LED will blink.
When there is nothing in the trigger reange of the motion sensor a green LED will be lit.

*if I get too it, the whole thing will only activate when a light sensor detcts no light.*

Stage 1: turns on a distance sensor and prints out the distance.
Stage 2: if the distance is greater or equal to 20cm the red LED will light up.
stage 3: same as stage 2 but a green LED will be lit if the sensor does not detect anything within 20cm.
stage 4: print Time and Date in a log file in /home/$USER each time the sensor detects anyhting within 20cm.
