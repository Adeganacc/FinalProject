The purpose of this device is to create a motion sensor that logs every time it is triggered in '/home/$USER'. 
Each time the motion sensor is triggered, a red LED will blink.
When there is nothing in the trigger reange of the motion sensor a green LED will be lit.

*if I get too it, the whole thing will only activate when a light sensor dedects no light.*
